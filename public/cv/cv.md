<div class="cv-section">

My name is Carlos Franco, I love solving problems and learning new things on the fly.

Last year I graduated as a Bachelor in Electrical Engineering. During graduation I specialized in designing power converters and control systems. Realizing that I could use programming to automate the design process is what drew me in the most.

For that reason am now interested in career as a software developer. The language I have worked the most with is Python, but I have also programmed in Java, C/C++, Javascript and VHDL.
