I am an Electrical Engineering Student. My main expertise is in designing power converters and embedded system
programming.

Nowadays I'm very interested in learning web development, and look foward to a career in the area.

The language I have worked the most with is Python, but I have also programmed in:

- Java:
  - Mostly GUI. 
  - I have also taught Java to my peers in college.
- C/C++: 
  - Programming microcontrollers.
- Javascript: 
  - I picked up this website template from Transversity Media, and made a few chages, such as the header, and the tag system. I look foward to making other projects in my spare time to increase my practical knowledge.

I'm a very proactive and easy going person and like to help whenever I can, but learned to take caution not to overburden myself while doing so.
