<div class="cv-section">

My name is Carlos Franco, I love solving problems and learning new things on the fly.

Last year I graduated as a Bachelor in Electrical Engineering. During graduation I specialized in designing power converters and control systems. Realizing where and how I could automate the design process is what drew me in the most.

Nowadays I'm very interested in learning web development, and look foward to a career in the area.

The language I have worked the most with is Python, but I have also programmed in Java, C/C++, Javascript and VHDL.
